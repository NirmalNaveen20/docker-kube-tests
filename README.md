# Docker & Kubernetes: The Practical Guide [2023 Edition]

Docker & Kubernetes are amongst the most in-demand technologies and topics you can learn these days.

Why?

Because they significantly simplify the development and deployment process of both simple and complex software projects. Especially in web development (though not limited to that), Docker can really take you to the next level!

With Docker, you create and manage so-called "Containers" - basically packages of code and tools required to run that code. These containers allow you to run your programs in a predictable, environment-independent way - no matter where you need to run it.

For modern DevOps but also for local development - on your own or in a team - this is a winner feature since you will no longer have any "but it worked on my machine" discussions. It works inside of a container, hence it works everywhere!
